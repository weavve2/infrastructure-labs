# infrastructure-labs
This repo is a collection of linux infrastructure labs I've built while teaching myself how systems fail, recover, and scale by building, breaking, and fixing them.
## Why does this exist?
I learn best by actually working in running systems, not just reading about them or watching videos.
These labs are about setting up these systems, breaking them in realistic ways, and recovering them.
This all started because I want to document my growth without forking over thousands of dollars on certs.
I began experimenting years ago using WSL/VirtualBox so I could setup and break things safely, but I never really had a place to show that work. 
This repo is how I’m journaling that learning process.
Eventually I want to invest in physical hardware and this repo is how I justify that cost.
## repo structure
Each lab will exist in its own folder and include steps, results, screenshots, and notes.
